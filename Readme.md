# Opinionated ArgoCD ApplicationSets

**ApplicationSet templates that actually work.**

## The Problem

Everyone needs monitoring, ingress, cert-manager, container registry, and other core services. Everyone struggles with ApplicationSet YAML. Nobody wants to spend hours debugging templates.

## The Solution

ApplicationSets for the most common Kubernetes patterns. Opinionated, tested, and working out of the box.  
Not pure copy-paste,  you should **fork this repo** and adapt the applicationsets to your own environment, escpecially the references to your own git repo.

## 📁 Available Templates

- **[monitoring/](monitoring/)** - kube-prometheus-stack with Loki and Grafana dashboards
- **[registry/harbor](registry/harbor)** - Harbor container registry with internal TLS

## 🎯 Philosophy

**Very opinionated** - We don't know your requirements, so these templates make sensible defaults:

- ✅ **Fork and adapt** - Clone or fork the repo, adjust values to your needs
- ✅ **Selector-based** - Uses ArgoCD cluster labels (add via IaC)
- ✅ **Secure defaults** - Auto-generated secrets, no hardcoded passwords
- ❌ **No ingress** - Too opinionated, every setup is different
- ❌ **No custom domains** - You know your DNS setup, we don't

## 🚀 Quick Start

0. **Fork this repo** and adjust the applicationsets to match your git Repo.

1. **Label your clusters** in ArgoCD:
   ```bash
   kubectl label secret my-cluster monitoring=enabled harbor=enabled
   ```

2. **Copy the ApplicationSet** you need:
   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moebiuscloud/argo-cd-applicationsets/main/monitoring/kube-prometheus-stack-with-loki/basic/applicationset.yaml
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moebiuscloud/argo-cd-applicationsets/main/registry/harbor/basic/applicationset.yaml
   ```

3. **Deploy via ArgoCD** (recommended - use an App of Apps pattern):
   ```bash
   # Add to your app-of-apps repository
   git add applicationset.yaml
   git commit -m "Add monitoring and harbor ApplicationSets"
   git push
   ```

   **Or apply directly** (for testing):
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f applicationset.yaml
   ```

4. **Access your services** (see individual READMEs for details)

## 🏷️ Cluster Label Requirements

Each template requires specific labels on your ArgoCD clusters:

- **monitoring**: `monitoring=enabled`
- **harbor**: `harbor=enabled`
- **cert-manager**: `cert-manager=enabled` (coming soon)
- **ingress**: `ingress=enabled` (coming soon)

Add these labels via Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Pulumi, etc.) for best results.
